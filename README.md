# Virtual-Library-API-with-Laravel

This project implements a virtual library API using Laravel. It provides endpoints for managing books and user authentication, leveraging Laravel Sanctum for secure token-based authentication.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and logout functionalities with Sanctum tokens.
- **Book Management**: CRUD operations for books, with support for filtering and searching by title, author, and category.
- **Admin Middleware**: Ensures that certain operations can only be performed by users with admin privileges.

## Seeders

Custom seeders have been created to populate the database with initial data:

- **Books**: Seven predefined books from various genres, including works by Gabriel García Márquez, George Orwell, and Jane Austen.
- **Users**: Two users have been seeded: one with admin privileges and one regular user.

## Preconfigured Postman Collection

A Postman collection is included, preconfigured with example requests and responses for each endpoint. The collection includes:

- **Authorization Header**: Requests are preconfigured with the appropriate Bearer Token for the admin and regular user.
- **Example Requests**: Demonstrates the use of the API endpoints, ensuring consistency with the data generated by the seeders.
